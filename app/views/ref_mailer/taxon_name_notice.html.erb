Hi <%= @recipient_person.first_name %>,

I wanted to tell you that <%= @updator.full_name %> has marked <%= @old_ref.display_name %> 
<%= @new_ref ? "as a duplicate" : "for deletion" %>. However, that reference is linked to one or more 
taxon names that <%= @updator.full_name %> does not have permission 
to modify. You have been contacted because you created at least
one of the taxon names in question.

To view the reference and finish the process, visit: 
<% if @new_ref -%>
  <%= url_for :controller => 'ref', :action => 'replace', :id => @old_ref, :replacement_ref_id => @new_ref, 
       :proj_id => @recipient_person.projs.first.id,
       :only_path => false,
       :host => HOME_SERVER %>
  (click 'replace' if you agree that this is a duplicate)
<% else -%>
  <%= url_for :controller => 'ref', :action => 'show', :id => @old_ref, 
       :proj_id => @recipient_person.projs.first.id,
       :only_path => false,
       :host => HOME_SERVER %>
  (click 'destroy' if you agree that is what should be done)
<% end -%>

To avoid getting more emails like this, you may want to ensure that
<%= @updator.full_name %> has permission to modify more taxon names.

Cheers,
mx
