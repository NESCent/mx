Two of the species (_carinata_ and _brevistyli_) have been reared from ceratitine and dacine tephritids, with nearly all records published under the name _giffardii_, a junior subjective synonym of _carinata_.  <ref id=QQQQ884QQQQ>Silvestri (1913)</ref> provided the first biological information when he described this species and named it _Hedylus giffardii_.

XXXXXXXXIn general appearance, members of the _Diachasmimorpha carinata_ species group very closely resemble species such as _Diachasmimorpha longicaudata_ because of the carinate sculpture on the second metasomal segment (as in Figure 8 in the Description section above) and pale coloration.

It is possible that these two species are the same.  The other species, _Diachasmimorpha insignis_, from Madagascar, does not have any host records, but its general similarity to _carinata_ and _brevistyli_ suggests a tephritid host. XXXXXXXX<a name=QQQQfullawayiQQQQ>*fullawayi group*</a>XXXXXXXXThe only other Afrotropical species of _Diachasmimorpha_ that has been reared from tephritids is <a href=QQQQ./?taxcpl=tax&amp;taxcpl_id=7571QQQQ>_Diachasmimorpha fullawayi_ (Silvestri)</a>. _Diachasmimorpha fullawayi_ differs in several respects from the three species of the _carinata_ group listed above.  It is most easily separated from them by the absence of sculpture on the second metasomal tergum.  However, this sculpture is sometimes weakly developed in males of _carinata_ (and perhaps the other species as well).  A more definitive character for separation is the presence of two small teeth along the midline at the apex of the clypeus in _Diachasmimorpha fullawayi_.  These may be difficult to see, but are otherwise diagnostic for this species.  XXXX XXXX<a name=QQQQlongicaudataQQQQ>*longicaudata group*</a>XXXXXXXXThe members of this species group with tephritid host records include _Diachasmimorpha albobalteata_ (Cameron), _Diachasmimorpha hageni_ (Fullaway)_, Diachasmimorpha kraussii_ (Fullaway), _Diachasmimorpha longicaudata_ (Ashmead), _Diachasmimorpha dacusii_ (Cameron), _Diachasmimorpha paeoniae_ (Tobias), and _Diachasmimorpha tryoni_ (Cameron).  This distinctive group, first recognized by <ref id=QQQQ109QQQQ>Fullaway (1951)</ref>, is readily defined by the apically sinuate ovipositor.  The members of this group also have the notauli deeply impressed along their full length.  Where known, the native hosts of most of these species are fruit-infesting tephritids in the genus _Bactrocera_ Macquart.  One species, _Diachasmimorpha paeoniae_, apparently occurs outside the range of _Bactrocera_ in Siberia, and has been reared from _Macrotrypeta ortalidina_ Portschinsky, a pest of flower buds.   The remaining species are more tropical in distribution, ranging from Australia and India through China and the Pacific Islands to southern Japan.  Both _Diachasmimorpha longicaudata_ and _Diachasmimorpha tryoni_ have been introduced to Hawaii, Florida, Latin America, and elsewhere, where they attack fruit-infesting tephritids in other genera such as _Anastrepha_ Schiner and _Ceratitis_ MacLeay. These two species are some of the most important and widely used species to date in tephritid biological control.  They have also been reared from gall-making tephritids, though uncommonly (<ref id=QQQQ751QQQQ>Duan and Messing, 1996</ref>).  The Australian species _Diachasmimorpha kraussii_ has also recently been introduced to Hawaii. XXXXXXXXThree additional species that may belong here, _Diachasmimorpha aino_ (Watanabe), _Diachasmimorpha budrysi_ van Achterberg, and _Diachasmimorpha feijeni_ van Achterberg, have yet to be thoroughly studied in terms of ovipositor morphology and so are treated separately.XXXX XXXXThe species of the _longicaudata_ species group are identified largely on the basis of color pattern, distribution, and the presence or absence of carinate sculpture on the second metasomal segment.  Color is unfortunately variable, and this is most obvious in _Diachasmimorpha longicaudata_, where color varieties have been described and even the genetic basis of a dark morph has been investigated.  Differences in chemical composition of the Hagen‚Äôs glands of males may be useful for distinguishing cryptic species, but much work remains to be done.  _Diachasmimorpha longicaudata_ and _Diachasmimorpha dacusii_ are distinguished largely by apparent differences in hosts but this situation needs further investigation.  An enormous amount of literature has been published on species in this species group, especially _Diachasmimorpha longicaudata_, primarily in association with biological control programs, and often using the generic names _Opius_ or _Biosteres_.XXXX XXXXThe following is a greatly simplified key to species of the _Diachasmimorpha longicaudata_ species group:XXXXXXXX1.

It contains _Diachasmimorpha mexicana_ (Cameron), for which there are no host records, and the tephritid parasitoids _Diachasmimorpha sanguinea_ (Ashmead), _Diachasmimorpha juglandis_ (Muesebeck), _Diachasmimorpha mellea_ (Gahan), and _Diachasmimorpha sublaevis_ (Wharton). The members of the _mexicana_ species group are parasitoids of fruit-infesting _Euphranta_ Loew, _Rhagoletis_ Loew, _Myoleja_ Rondani, and _Zonosemata_ Benjamin.  The species group is essentially Nearctic, ranging south into Mexico.XXXXXXXXThe origin of m-cu in the short second submarginal cell of the fore wing, the inclivous 1cu-a widely separated from 1M, the double node on the ovipositor, the venom apparatus, and the morphology of the clypeus and mandible all suggest a close relationship with both of the Old World species groups: the _longicaudata_ species group and the _carinata_ species group.  The _Diachasmimorpha mexicana_ species group differs from the _longicaudata_ group in the more weakly developed notauli (best developed in _mellea_, where it is usually still visible as a faint impression posteriorly), the more posterior origin of RS+M (1RS/1M > 0.20), and the straight ovipositor.  Thus, the _mexicana_ species group, and in particular _Diachasmimorpha mellea_, _Diachasmimorpha juglandis_, and _Diachasmimorpha sublaevis_, is more similar to the _carinata_ species group than to the _longicaudata_ species group.  Whether these similarities are sufficient to justify a sister-group relationship remains to be tested, since the most obvious traits involved are either plesiomorphic (straight ovipositor) or occur repeatedly within the Opiinae (reduced notauli).  XXXXXXXX_Diachasmimorpha mellea_ differs in a number of respects from _Diachasmimorpha sanguinea_ and the nearly identical _Diachasmimorpha mexicana_.  The somewhat intermediate position of _Diachasmimorpha juglandis_ and _Diachasmimorpha sublaevis_ tentatively unites the group as a whole,  but there is some justification for splitting this species group in two since _Diachasmimorpha sanguinea_ and _Diachasmimorpha mexicana_ both have the occipital carina absent or nearly so, and the hypopygium is uncharacteristically shortened.XXXX XXXXThe following is a greatly simplified key to species of the _Diachasmimorpha mexicana_ species group:XXXXXXXX1.

100	"Eucoilines have been reared from hosts representing a wide range of microhabitats, and several species have been reared from flies breeding in fruit. Relatively few of the eucoilines reared from fruit have been unequivocally associated with tephritid hosts. The most reliable host records from Tephritidae are for the genera _Aganaspis_ and _Odontosema_. Three species of _Aganaspis_ and one species of _Odontosema_ have been repeatedly reared both from isolated puparia of tephritids and from samples that produced only tephritids and no other Diptera, thus confirming their status as hosts.XXXXXXXXAdditionally, there are published records for _Dicerataspis_ and _Lopheucoila_ that strongly suggest that members of these genera at least occasionally attack Tephritidae even though they normally attack hosts in other families. At least one species of _Ealata_ has been also reared on several occasions from fruit infested with tephritids, but hosts are as yet unconfirmed. Finally, there are records of _Rhoptomeris_ and _Trybliographa_ attacking tephritids in the New World, but these are likely misidentifications of some of the more difficult and poorly defined New World genera of eucoilines. A revision of the New World genera will be necessary before these host relationships can be clarified. <ref id=QQQQ2623QQQQ>Wharton et al. (1998)</ref> provide a detailed summary of published records referring to species of _Rhoptromeris_ and _Trybliographa_ that have been associated with tephritids. XXXX XXXXMany of the eucoilines reared from fruits are actually parasitoids of Drosophilidae, Lonchaeidae, Phoridae or other flies associated with ripe and decomposing fruit. Members of the genus _Leptopilina_, for example, are well-known as parasitoids of Drosophilidae and are among the mostly commonly encountered eucoilines reared from fruit samples in the Afrotropics. Though Drosophilidae tend to colonize fruit after tephritids have departed to pupate in the soil, there is potential for overlap. For example, fruits that have fallen from a tree may have more rapidly decaying portions inhabited by Drosophilidae at the same time as more sound portions still inhabited by tephritid larvae. Since fruit is often collected and reared in bulk, it is easy to obtain parasitoids of both Drosophilidae and Tephritidae from the same sample. Thus, in order to assess host specificity accurately, it is essential to verify all records by isolating individual puparia or exposing known hosts to ovipositing females. For many of the older records (including label data from unpublished studies), this was not done and host associations must therefore be viewed with caution. It is likely that the tephritid host records for _Rhoptromeris haywardi_ (Blanchard) and _Trybliographa brasiliensis_ (von Ihering) actually refer to drosophilids for these reasons. Puparia of most fruit-infesting tephritids do not have the posterior spiracles protruding from the surface and this will help in distinguishing them from many of the other Diptera noted here.XXXXXXXXSince most fruit-infesting tephritids are considerably larger than fruit-infesting drosophilids, and their eucoiline parasitoids are solitary, it is therefore often possible to distinguish drosophilid parasitoids from tephritid parasitoids simply by differences in their size. Some tephritids are quite small, however, making such associations somewhat risky in the absence of isolated puparia."	"0000-00-00 00:00:00"	"2005-01-24 18:53:21"	"wharton"

Care should be taken to confirm any rearings of _Trichopria_ and _Spilomicrus_ (Figs. 3,4) from tephritid hosts.  _Spilomicrus hemipterus_ has been collected from puparia of _Anomoia purmunda_ infesting _Crataegus_, and from various _Rhagoletis_ species infesting _Lonicera_, _Prunus_, and _Berberis_ in Europe (<ref id=QQQQ795QQQQ>Hoffmeister 1992</ref>).

168	"_Psyttalia_ is a fairly large, Old World genus, with about 50 described species.  Maximum diversity occurs in the region from Africa east through India and Southeast Asia.  One species, _Psyttalia concolor_, has been distributed throughout much of the world for biological control programs against various pest tephritids. Of the 20 other species with confirmed rearings from fruit-infesting tephritid hosts, 3 are Palaearctic, 2 are found on islands in the southwestern Indian Ocean, 7 are Indo-Pacific, and 8 are from the Afrotropics.  Two of the Indo-Pacific species, _Psyttalia incisi_ and _Psyttalia fletcheri_, are both established in Hawaii, where they were released against Oriental fruit fly, _Bactrocera dorsalis_ (Hendel), and melon fly, _Bactrocera cucurbitae_ (Coquillett), respectively.XXXXXXXXThe _vittator_ species group, attacking tephritids in flower heads, is not further discussed here (see <ref id=QQQQ955QQQQ>Wharton 1997</ref>).  The distinctive _Psyttalia acidoxanthicida_ (Fullaway), with its strongly bowed hind wing cubital vein, is a parasitoid of tephritids in flowers or buds and thus is also not further treated here.XXXXXXXX*Western Indian Ocean*XXXXXXXXThe two species occurring in Madagascar and the Mascarenes, _Psyttalia insignipennis_ (Granger) and Psyttalia _distinguenda_ (Granger) are readily separated from one another by the absence of an occipital carina in _insignipennis_.

(1999)</ref>.XXXX XXXX*Palaearctic*XXXXXXXX<ref id=QQQQ1023QQQQ>Tobias (1977)</ref> provided a key for separation of two of the Palaearctic species, _Psyttalia ophthalmica_ (Tobias) and _Psyttalia rhagoleticola_ (Sachtleben), from _Psyttalia concolor_. _Psyttalia ophthalmica_ is a darker species than the other two, with a slightly longer ovipositor and a coarsely punctate face. _Psyttalia rhagoleticola_ has distinctly longer antennae than _Psyttalia concolor_ (approximately 40 antennal segments in _Psyttalia rhagoleticola_ and nearly always less than 35 antennal segments in _Psyttalia concolor_).  _Psyttalia ophthalmica_ is known only from the Maritime Region of far eastern Russia, around Vladivostok, where it has been reared from _Rhagoletis_ in _Lonicera_ and briars. _Psyttalia rhagoleticola_ has a much more western distribution, occurring from western Europe to Kazakhstan, where it attacks various species of _Rhagoletis_, including Palaearctic cherry fruit fly, _Rhagoletis cerasi_.  _Psyttalia rhagoleticola_ also attacks _Myoleja lucida_ (Fall√©n) larvae (<ref id=QQQQ795QQQQ>Hoffmeister 1992</ref>).  The distribution of _Psyttalia rhagoleticola_ may overlap that of the other Palaearctic species, _Psyttalia ponerophaga_ (Silvestri), known only from a single collection in Cherat, northern Pakistan, but the latter species was reared from olive fly in apparently wild olives. _Psyttalia ponerophaga_ is one of the few parasitoids of fruit-infesting tephritids in this genus in which the fore wing m-cu enters the second submarginal cell.  It is thus readily identified relative to the other 3 species discussed in this paragraph. _Psyttalia concolor_ has been collected from olive fly, _Bactrocera oleae_, in Jordan (<ref id=QQQQ807QQQQ>Mustafa and Al-Zaghal 1987</ref>) and Crete (<ref id=QQQQ960QQQQ>Bigler et al. 1986</ref>).XXXX XXXX*Indo-Pacific*XXXX     XXXXThe 7 species from the Indo-Pacific region include 2 species, _Psyttalia makii_ (Sonan) and _Psyttalia walkeri_ (Muesebeck), with venation somewhat similar to that found in _Psyttalia concolor_ (_concolor, _Fig. 1).  The vein segment between m-cu and 2RS is usually distinctly thickened in part in _Psyttalia makii_ but barely so or not at all in _Psyttalia walkeri_.  The base of the second metasomal segment tends to be more polished in these two species than in _Psyttalia concolor_.  _Psyttalia makii_ was originally described from Taiwan but was subsequently recorded from the Philippines and Thailand.  _Psyttalia walkeri_, originally collected in Sri Lanka, has also been recorded from Indonesia and Malaysia.  Both species have been reared from various hosts in the _Bactrocera dorsalis_ complex, as well as a few other species of _Bactrocera_.XXXXXXXXThe _fletcheri_ species group.  The specific form of the thickening and curvature of the various vein segments (_fijiensis, _Fig. 2), in addition to the somewhat longer second metasomal tergum (relative to _concolor_, for example), define the _fletcheri_ group of species. _ Psyttalia fijiensis_ (Fullaway), _Psyttalia fletcheri_, _Psyttalia incisi_, _Psyttalia muesebecki_ (Fischer), and _Psyttalia novaguineensis_ (Sz√©pligeti) all belong to this species group.     XXXXXXXXThree of these species, _Psyttalia fijiensis_, _Psyttalia muesebecki_, and _Psyttalia novaguineensis_ have fore wing 2RS thickened medially (_fijiensis_, Fig. 2).  Thickening of fore wing 2RS was used by <ref id=QQQQ482QQQQ>Fischer (1972)</ref> to redefine the genus _Austroopius_ Sz√©pligeti, though he recognized that some apparently closely related species lacked this characteristic.  <ref id=QQQQ761QQQQ>Wharton (1987)</ref> confirmed the close resemblance of species such as _fletcheri_, which lack the thickened 2RS, to the species of _Austroopius_ and therefore synonymized _Austroopius_ under _Psyttalia_.  The three species with a medially thickened 2RS have generally been separated from one another by coloration of the fore wing and sculpture of the propodeum (<ref id=QQQQ521QQQQ>Fischer 1987</ref>), but both these features are somewhat variable.   _Psyttalia fijiensis_ tends to have the fore wing darkened medially while the fore wing of the other two species tends to be more uniformely hyaline.  _Psyttalia muesebecki_ apparently lacks a median carina on the propodeum but this is present in _Psyttalia novaguineensis_. _Psyttalia fijiensis_ is more widely distributed than the other two, and consequently has a wider range of hosts (<ref id=QQQQ762QQQQ>Wharton and Gilstrap 1983</ref>).  _Psyttalia muesebecki_ is known only from New Caledonia.XXXXXXXXThe two remaining species, _Psyttalia fletcheri_ and_ Psyttalia incisi_, are very similar to one another in the curvature of fore wing m-cu and distally enlarged subdiscal cell, but m-cu is more basally displaced in _Psyttalia incisi_, resulting in a different pattern of thickening (_incisi_, Fig. 3 and _fletcheri_, Fig. 4).  Both species were originally described from India and subsequently introduced to and established in Hawaii.  _Psyttalia fletcheri_ attacks the melon fly, _Bactrocera cucurbitae_ and _Psyttalia incisi_ attacks Oriental fruit fly, _Bactrocera dorsalis_.

Three of the species, _Psyttalia dacicida_ (Silvestri) reared from _Bactrocera oleae_ in Eritrea, _Psyttalia dexter_ (Silvestri) reared from _Dacus longistylus_ in Senegal, and _Psyttalia inconsueta_ (Silvestri) reared from  _Carpophthoromyia tritea_ in southern Nigeria are basically known only from Silvestri‚Äôs original collections in made prior to 1914. _Psyttalia lounsburyi_ (Silvestri) is also similar to _concolor_ and the other species mentioned here but is much darker in coloration (_lounsburyi_ Fig. 5, _concolor_ Fig. 6).  It has been reared from olive fly infesting wild and cultivated olives in South Africa and wild olives in Kenya.XXXXXXXXTwo species, _Psyttalia cosyrae_ (Wilkinson) and _Psyttalia phaeostigma_ (Wilkinson) have distinctly longer ovipositors (_cosyrae,_ Fig. 7) than all of the others.  _Psyttalia cosyrae_ has been reared from _Ceratitis cosyra_ infesting mangoes and a few wild host plants in Kenya and Tanzania.  _Psyttalia phaeostigma_ has been reared from _Dacus ciliatus_ infesting cucurbits in Kenya."

169	"Many of the species are difficult to separate from one another.  Some of the characters of potential use in their separation, such as the fine sculpture on the second metasomal tergum,  are subject to post-mortem changes.  The female reproductive tract also shows some interspecific variation, but has been examined in only a few species.  For these reasons, it is easiest to treat the species on a regional basis, and hence information on identification of the species will be found above in the Distribution section.XXXXXXXX* General Considerations for Identification of Species in the Genus _Psyttalia_.  *As indicated in the discussion of the* *_fletcheri_ species group, many of the species of _Psyttalia_ have the veins of the fore wing variously thickened at the junction of  m-cu and RS+M, and in about 80% of the described species, fore wing 1cu-a (which is usually thickened) is distad of 1M by at least its own length and is often inclivous.  The curvature, position, and thickening of the veins in these regions are among the most useful characters for separation of the species.  The length of the ovipositor or ovipositor sheath also varies among species, but these structures are often partially retracted and difficult to measure accurately without dissection.  Metasomal glands may offer a suite of characters suitable for defining species groups or even the genus as a whole as monophyletic, but more extensive surveys are needed before the value of these features can be ascertained.  Interesting possibilities include the secretory cells of the Hagen's gland, which form a large, bulbous mass in which the tubules are embedded in at least four species (<ref>Buckingham and Sharkey 1988</ref>) and the presence of a round, virus-filled bulb attached to the base of the poison gland in at least two African species."

About 80% of the records are from fruit-infesting tephritids, with the remainder attacking flower-infesting tephritids.  Those attacking tephritids in flower heads are, as a group, morphologically distinct from those attacking tephritids in fruits, and there appears to be no overlap in host habitat based on field-collected material.  The evolution of host shifts in these groups of _Psyttalia_ would be an interesting topic to explore.

The efficacy of _Psyttalia humilis_ and three other introduced species was extensively documented over a 23 year period (<ref id=QQQQ1007QQQQ>Pemberton and Willard, 1918</ref>; <ref id=QQQQ356QQQQ>Willard and Mason, 1937</ref>), and detailed biologies were published by <ref id=QQQQ239QQQQ>Pemberton and Willard (1918)</ref>.  All four species were still established in 1933, the last year for which data are available from this program, with _Psyttalia humilis_ and _Diachasmimorpha tryoni_ (Cameron) exhibiting roughly equivalent levels of parasitism on medfly.  The principle benefit of these introductions was the considerable reduction in infestation levels in coffee, which had previously been so badly infested that the coffee berries could not ripen (<ref id=QQQQ356QQQQ>Willard and Mason, 1937</ref>).  Infestations in other fruits was also reduced, though not as much in large, fleshy, preferred fruits such as mango.  Nevertheless, reduced infestations made it possible to integrate other control measures more successfully, and eliminate medfly in some non-preferred fruits.  _Psyttalia humilis_ was last recorded from Hawaii in 1933 and subsequently disappeared for reasons unknown.XXXXXXXXDuring the exploration phase of the Oriental fruit fly program, several of the opiines from Kenya were variously identified as color varieties of _Psyttalia concolor_ or as _Psyttalia perproxima_ (<ref id=QQQQ54QQQQ>Clausen et al. 1965</ref>).  Material from the same localities had been identified as either _P. humilis_ or _P. perproxima_ during an earlier sampling program (<ref id=QQQQ812QQQQ>Bianchi and Krauss, 1936</ref>).  Difficulty in identification of these three species is still a problem, and uncertainty over whether or not they are distinct makes it difficult to correctly associate previously published host records.  Similarly, two decades after the purposeful introduction of _P. concolor_ to Italy to control olive fly, _Bactrocera oleae_ (Rossi), <ref id=QQQQ186QQQQ>Monastero (1931)</ref> described _Psyttalia siculus_ from Sicily as a parasitoid of _B. oleae_.

Although there are no publications on hosts or biology for any of the species, we have reared _Ealata_ from fruits infested with tephritids in both Cameroons and Kenya.  Verification of hosts is still needed, since some of these fruit samples produced drosophilids and other flies besides tephritids.

188	"All species of _Fopius_ reared to date are parasitoids of Tephritidae.  A few generalizations can be made about hosts and distribution patterns, even though our current knowledge is somewhat limited. Native hosts in all of the species groups of _Fopius_ treated below include members of the subtribes Ceratitidina and/or Dacina, both in the tephritid tribe Dacini, subfamily Trypetinae (<ref>Norrbom et al. 1998</ref>).  Except where they have been introduced for biological control, members of the _persulcatus_ species group occur outside the range of fruit-infesting Ceratitidina, and several of them have been reared from members of the tribe Trypetini in addition to members of the Dacina.  Rearing records from within their native ranges (<ref id=QQQQ54QQQQ>Clausen et al. 1965</ref>, <ref id=QQQQ799QQQQ>Steck et al. 1986</ref>) suggest that the 17 species of _Fopius_ for which we have host records are restricted to fruit-infesting tephritids, but that there are different levels of specificity.  Some are currently known only from a single host, others (e. g. _Fopius caudatus_ on ceratitidines) have only been reared from a narrow group of hosts, and several have been reared from both Dacini and Trypetini.  Where introduced outside their native range for biological control, _Fopius arisanus_ and _Fopius vandenboschi_ have been able to attack other fruit-infesting tephritids (<ref id=QQQQ54QQQQ>Clausen et al. 1965</ref>, <ref id=QQQQ843QQQQ>Wharton et al. 1981</ref>).  Although some of the species of _Diachasmimorpha_ introduced to Hawaii to control fruit-infesting Tephritidae occasionally attack gall-making (but not flower-infesting) Tephritidae, _Fopius arisanus_ and _Fopius vandenboschi_ do not (<ref id=QQQQ819QQQQ>Duan et al. 1996</ref>).  XXXXXXXXOviposition in the egg stage of the host is an intriguing biological feature, and one that has been of considerable interest to biological control workers.  This phenomenon has been well documented in _Fopius arisanus_ (Sonan), (most of the biological information on this species was published under the species name _oophilus_ Fullaway), perhaps the most significant parasitoid introduced to Hawaii for tephritid biological control (<ref id=QQQQ54QQQQ>Clausen et al. 1965</ref>).  Evidence that this biological trait is found in several other species of _Fopius_ is gradually accumulating (see recent discussion by <ref id=QQQQ637QQQQ>Waterhouse 1993</ref>).  Based solely on ovipositor morphology, it is likely that the following species share this trait with _arisanus_: _Fopius carpomyiae_ (Silvestri), _Fopius persulcatus_ (Silvestri), _Fopius schlingeri_ Wharton and _Fopius caudatus_ (Sz√©pligeti)."

Although the mandible lacks the modifications found in most species of _Rhynchosteres_, the midventral portion of the clypeus in members of the _Fopius desideratus_ species group is at least slightly thickened and weakly protruding.  Additionally, the relative length of the first two flagellomeres in the _Fopius desideratus_ species group is as in _Rhynchosteres_, the petiole is similarly structured (flatter and narrower than in more typical species of _Fopius_, such as _Fopius silvestrii_), and most significantly, the ovipositor sheath shows an identical pattern of setal reduction."

Only one species, _Fopius okekai_ <ref id=QQQQ1223QQQQ>Kimani-Njogu and Wharton, 2002</ref>, has been described since then. XXXX XXXX_Fopius persulcatus_ species groupXXXXXXXXThe _Fopius persulcatus_ species group is characterized largely by striate sculpture on the second metasomal tergum. The frons is also densely covered with large punctures, these sometimes coalescing to form rugulose or rugulo-striate sculpture.  This species group consists of _Fopius alternatae_ (Tobias) and _Fopius myolejae_ (Tobias) from Russia; and the Indo-Pacific species _Fopius arisanus_ (Sonan), _Fopius carpomyiae_ (Silvestri), _Fopius persulcatus_ (Silvestri), _Fopius skinneri_ (Fullaway), and _Fopius vandenboschi_ (Fullaway).  The species are very similar to one another, but differ primarily in coloration, length of ovipositor, and configuration of the ovipositor tip.  Following their successful introduction to Hawaii during the biological control program against oriental fruit fly (<ref id=QQQQ54QQQQ>Clausen et al. 1965</ref>), _Fopius arisanus_ and _Fopius vandenboschi_ were intensively studied, and much is now known about their biology (with most of the early literature on _arisanus_ published under the name _Opius oophilus_ Fullaway).  Other than the original host records, however, little is known about the other species.  Data on _persulcatus_ are particularly problematic because of widespread confusion regarding the identity of this species during the Hawaiian oriental fruit fly program, and the subsequent description of several subspecies (<ref id=QQQQ444QQQQ>Fischer 1963</ref>).  Though the best known species are parasitoids of tephritids in the dacine genus _Bactrocera_ Macquart in their native range, other species have been reared from trypetine tephritids in the genera _Carpomya_ Costa, _Myoleja_ Rondani, and _Rhagoletis_ Loew.  Based on the similarities in the shape of the ovipositor tip, these species preferentially attack either the egg or early instar larva of their host (though all eventually emerge from the puparium).  This biology, however, has only been confirmed for _arisanus_ (attacking eggs) and _vandenboschi_ (attacking primarily first instars).  The species of this group are known from Pakistan and India east through Indonesia and north through Taiwan, Japan, and far eastern Russia.XXXX XXXX_Fopius desideratus_ species group.  XXXXXXXXMembers of this species group that have been reared from fruit-infesting tephritids include _Fopius bevisi_ (Brues), _Fopius desideratus_ (Bridwell), _Fopius niger_ (Sz√©pligeti), _Fopius ottotomoanus_ (Fullaway) and _Fopius okekai_ Kimani-Njogu and Wharton.  As noted above, this group is characterized by the reduced setae on the ovipositor sheath, slight thickening medially along the ventral margin of the clypeus, and a longer, somewhat flatter petiole than is found in members of the _Fopius silvestrii_ group (discussed below).  The punctation on the frons tends to be weaker, with transverse striae usually clearly present medially.  The species of the _Fopius desideratus_ species group are very similar to one another, differing primarily in color.  Members of this species group have been collected from Cameroon and Nigeria east to Kenya and Tanzania as well as South Africa and Madagascar, and undoubtedly occur throughout subsaharan Africa. Most but not all of the specimens reared to date have been from _Dacus_ infesting Cucurbitaceae. The few remaining records were from ceratitidine tephritids on various hosts.  All members of this species group have large, subapical nodes on the ovipositor, suggesting that they may attack late instar larvae of their hosts. XXXX XXXX_Fopius silvestrii_ species group.  XXXXXXXXThis group is currently defined largely by the absence of features that define the two species groups already mentioned: the second metasomal tergum is unsculptured and the setae on the ovipositor sheath are not reduced. Both _Fopius silvestrii_ (Wharton) and _Fopius ceratitivorus_ Wharton have been reared from medfly, _Ceratitis capitata_, infesting coffee, and _Fopius silvestrii_ has also been reared from _Dacus bivittatus_ (Bigot) infesting squash (<ref id=QQQQ799QQQQ>Steck et al. 1986</ref>, <ref id=QQQQ761QQQQ>Wharton 1987</ref>).  The two other members of this species group have not been reared.  Members of the _Fopius silvestrii_ species group have much the same distribution pattern as those of the _Fopius desideratus_ species group, and are differentiated from one another largely by color (_Fopius silvestrii_ is dark and _Fopius ceratitivorus_ is pale) and ovipositor length.  _Fopius ceratitivorus_ is known only from Kenya and extreme northeastern South Africa; _Fopius silvestrii_ has been collected in West Africa and western Kenya.XXXX XXXXOther species groupsXXXXXXXXThe remaining three species, _Fopius caudatus_ (Sz√©pligeti), _Fopius deeralensis_ (Fullaway), and _Fopius schlingeri_ Wharton, do not readily cluster into distinctive species groups.  _Fopius caudatus_ is readily separated from all other species of _Fopius_ by the distinctive band of setae and punctures on the frons extending between the eye and ocelli.  _Fopius caudatus_ resembles members of the _Fopius desideratus_ species group in the morphology of the clypeus and petiole, but has a distinctly different ovipositor (strongly narrowed, suggesting oviposition in the host egg) as well as several features unusual for members of the genus _Fopius_ (<ref id=QQQQ955QQQQ>Wharton 1997</ref>).  The commonly collected _Fopius caudatus_ also superficially resembles _Fopius silvestrii_, and both have been reared from ceratitidines in coffee samples. _Fopius caudatus_ has thus far been reared exclusively from ceratitidines (<ref id=QQQQ799QQQQ>Steck et al. 1986</ref>, <ref id=QQQQ1228QQQQ>Wharton et al. 2000</ref>), and is known from tropical regions of both eastern and western Africa.  XXXXXXXXBoth _Fopius deeralensis_ and _Fopius schlingeri_ are from Queensland, where they have been reared from various species of _Bactrocera_ in a variety of host fruits (<ref id=QQQQ54QQQQ>Clausen et al. 1965</ref>, <ref id=QQQQ955QQQQ>Wharton 1997</ref>).  _Fopius schlingeri_, for example, attacks at least four species of _Bactrocera_ developing in the fruit of at least three plant families.  _Fopius deeralensis_ differs from _Fopius schlingeri_ in having the ventral margin of the clypeus distinctly pointed midventrally, a distinct subapical ridge on the ovipositor, and the second metasomal tergum is usually weakly striate, at least basally.  There are slight differences among species of _Fopius_ in the exposure of the labrum and _Fopius schlingeri_ provides a good example of a species with a partially exposed labrum.  The ovipositor in _Fopius schlingeri_ is virtually identical in form to that of _Fopius arisanus_, strongly suggesting a biology similar to the latter in which the parasitoid oviposits into the egg of its host.  Field observations kindly supplied by Greg Quimio during his PhD research at the University of Queensland appear to confirm this.  These two Australian group differ in only minor ways from members of the _Fopius persulcatus_ group, and may need to be included there after further study."

206	"The Opiinae is one of the largest subfamilies in the Braconidae, with over 1500 described species.  A little over 100 of these have been reared from fruit-infesting Tephritidae.  All opiine braconids reared to date are koinobiont endoparasitoids of cyclorrhaphous Diptera, emerging from the puparium of their hosts.  Hosts are known for only about one-third of the described species of Opiinae, with most of these records pertaining to Agromyzidae, Tephritidae, and Anthomyiidae (<ref id=QQQQ608QQQQ>Fischer 1971</ref>, <ref id=QQQQ482QQQQ>1972</ref>, <ref id=QQQQ492QQQQ>1977</ref>, <ref id=QQQQ521QQQQ>1987</ref>; <ref>Shaw and Huddleston 1991</ref>).

(2000)</ref>.  XXXX XXXXPerhaps the largest on-line resource of literature and taxonomic information for the Opiinae is available at <a href=QQQQhttp://hymenoptera.tamu.edu:2222/opiineQQQQ>here</a>.  We have developed it in conjunction with our NSF-PEET grants (see <a href=QQQQhttp://hymenoptera.tamu.edu/peet/QQQQ>http://hymenoptera.tamu.edu/peet/</a>).XXXX XXXXThe opiine parasitoids of tephritids comprise several distinct lineages (<ref id=QQQQ1023QQQQ>Tobias 1977</ref>, <ref id=QQQQ955QQQQ>Wharton 1997</ref>).  It is likely that tephritid parasitism in the Opiinae represents multiple, independent evolutionary events.  However, the alternative hypothesis that parasitism of tephritids is simply a plesiomorphic trait of the subfamily as a whole cannot be completely discounted.XXXX XXXXThe classification of the Opiinae used here is derived from that of <ref id=QQQQ482QQQQ>Fischer (1972)</ref>.  <ref id=QQQQ482QQQQ>Fischer (1972</ref>, <ref id=QQQQ492QQQQ>1977</ref>, <ref id=QQQQ521QQQQ>1987</ref>) treated the world species of Opiinae, and placed nearly all of the known species of tephritid parasitoids in two subgenera within _Opius_ and in six other genera outside _Opius_.  Recent works on the Opiinae by <ref id=QQQQ727QQQQ>Tobias and Jakimavicius (1986)</ref>, <ref id=QQQQ761QQQQ>Wharton (1987</ref>, <ref id=QQQQ736QQQQ>1988</ref>), and <ref id=QQQQ921QQQQ>van Achterberg and Maet√¥ (1990)</ref>, building on the work of <ref id=QQQQ1023QQQQ>Tobias (1977)</ref>, <ref id=QQQQ738QQQQ>Wharton and Marsh (1978)</ref>, <ref id=QQQQ734QQQQ>Wharton (1983)</ref>, and <ref id=QQQQ762QQQQ>Wharton and Gilstrap (1983)</ref>, have led to substantial changes in the taxa to which these tephritid parasitoids were formerly assigned.  Most notable among these changes are the restriction in the definition of _Biosteres_ F√∂rster, and elevation of _Psyttalia_ Walker and _Utetes_ F√∂rster to generic rank. Those genera characterized by a short second submarginal cell (_Diachasmimorpha_, _Doryctobracon_, _Fopius_, and _Rhynchosteres_)  have often had their species placed in _Biosteres_ or elsewhere within Fischer's subtribe Biosterina at one time or another.  XXXX XXXXBased on the classification used here, the parasitoids of fruit-infesting tephritids are hypothesized to fall into four major groups: 1) the _Diachasmimorpha_ group of genera (_Diachasmimorpha_, _Fopius_, and the three species currently assigned to _Diachasma_), 2) the genus _Psyttalia_, 3) the genus _Utetes_ + the _Opius froggatti_ species group, and 4) the _Opius bellus_ species group (treated as the subgenus _Bellopius_).  Other opiines reared from fruit-infesting tephritids (e.g. _Opius downesi_ Gahan, and some of the species of _Sternaulopius_) may represent relatively isolated evolutionary forays into tephritid parasitism, but more host records are needed to confirm this.   The genus _Doryctobracon_ shares many features with the _Diachasmimorpha_ group (Wharton 1997), but its relationship to other groups of tephritid parasitoids still needs to be explored further.

207	"The genus _Opius_ is arguably one of the largest in the family Braconidae, though <ref id=QQQQ922QQQQ>van Achterberg (1997)</ref> has recently attempted to split the genus into roughly two equal parts on the basis of the presence or absence of a basal tooth on the mandible.  Since only a few species have been formally placed using this subdivision, I am using the broader concept of _Opius_ (_Opius_ sensu lato) for the few species that are know to attack fruit-infesting Tephritidae.  In addition to the subgenus <a href=QQQQ./?taxcpl=tax&amp;taxcpl_id=7649QQQQ>_Bellopius_</a>, treated separately, the species included in _Opius_ and treated below are _Opius baldufi_ Muesebeck, _Opius buck_i Costa Lima, _Opius downesi_ Gahan, _Opius froggatti_ Fullaway, _Opius mariae_ Tobias, and _Opius tafivallensis_ Fischer.  Most of these species seem unrelated to one another or to the other genera and species groups of Opiinae that attack fruit-infesting Tephritidae.

208	"Two of the species, _Opius bucki_ and _Opius tafivallensis_, have the occipital carina absent.  This feature is present in the other four species treated here.  _Opius bucki_ and _Opius tafivallensis_ are Neotropical species and are readily distinguished from one another by their coloration and propodeal sculpture.  _Opius tafivallensis_, a black and white species with no propodeal sculpture, has been reared from a tephritid in the genus _Gerrhoceras_.  _Opius bucki_ , a species that is mostly yellow with some black markings, and with coarsely reticulate-rugose propodeal sculpture, was originally thought to have been reared from an unknown tephritid (but see _bucki_ page).  No additional information is available on these two species (see summary in <ref id=QQQQ738QQQQ>Wharton and Marsh 1978</ref>).XXXXXXXXTwo of the remaining species are from the Old World and two are from the Nearctic Region.  The Old World species _Opius froggatti_ is known from Australia and New Caledonia and has been reared from at least three species of _Bactrocera_ (<ref id=QQQQ762QQQQ>Wharton and Gilstrap 1983</ref>).  _Opius mariae_ is known only from the southeastern corner of Russia, where it has been reared from _Myoleja sinensis_ (Zia) in _Lonicera_ fruit as well as _Acidiella echinopanasis_ Kandybina and possibly _Rhagoletis reducta_ Hering (<ref id=QQQQ1023QQQQ>Tobias 1977</ref>).   XXXXXXXX_Opius baldufi_ and _Opius downesi_, the two Nearctic species, both have a short hypopygium and share identical features of the clypeus and mandibles with the true members of the genus _Biosteres_.  The general pattern of the fore and hind wing venation is also the same, but the second submarginal cell is slightly longer, and the second metasomal tergum is striate.  Based on the number of shared characteristics, it is likely that these two species will eventually be placed in or near _Biosteres_ sensus stricto when this section of the Opiinae is revised.  In the restricted sense used here, however, the known hosts of _Biosteres_ belong almost exclusively to leaf-mining Anthomyiidae, and there are as yet no records from Tephritidae.  _Opius baldufi_ is a parasitoid of _Rhagoletis basiola_ whereas _Opius downesi_ has been reared from four other species: _Rhagoletis berberis_, _Rhagoletis pomonella_, _Rhagoletis tabellaria_, and _Rhagoletis zephyria_ (<ref id=QQQQ738QQQQ>Wharton and Marsh 1978</ref>, <ref>Maier 1981</ref>).  _Opius downesi_ has a slightly longer ovipositor than _Opius baldufi_.  _Opius baldufi_ has a more restricted distribution in the midwestern US and Utah whereas _Opius downesi _apparently occurs all across northern US and southern Canada.  <ref id=QQQQ229QQQQ>Nishida and Haramoto (1953)</ref> tested the capability of _Opius oophilus_, an egg-larval parasitoid of _Bactrocera dorsalis_, to attack _Bactrocera cucurbitae_ in Hawaii where the two tephritid flies have overlapping distributions.  _O. oophilus_ readily oviposited in _B. cucurbitae_ causing up to 80% mortality of fly eggs, but failed to develop to the adult stage.  Nishida and Haramoto found _B. cucurbitae_ to be immune to parasitoids of _B. dorsalis_, including _Fopius vandenboschi_, _Psytallia incisi_, _Diachasmimorpha longicaudatus_, and _P. fletcheri_."

209	"This is one of the largest families in the Chalcidoidea.  Several genera of pteromalids have been reared from fly puparia, including tephritids, but relatively few from fruit-infesting tephritids.

Previously published host and distribution data are summarized in <ref id=QQQQ2613QQQQ>LaSalle and Wharton (2002)</ref>.  _Tetrastichus giffardianus_ is readily separated from the other two species by the absence of setae in the broad area near the base of the fore wing (Figure 3).

Second abdominal tergum smooth or with basal pits (_perkinsi, _Fig. 15)XXXX     <a href=QQQQ#truncatusQQQQ>_Utetes truncatus_ species group</a> XXXX XXXX*The <a name=QQQQanastrephaeQQQQ>_Utetes anastrephae_</a> species group*XXXX  XXXX The Neotropical species placed by <ref id=QQQQ492QQQQ>Fischer (1977)</ref> in _Bracanastrepha_ form a distinct species group based on the complete loss of the occipital carina.  The species that also possess a distinct carina at the base of the hind tibia were transferred to _Utetes_ by <ref id=QQQQ736QQQQ>Wharton (1988)</ref>, who retained the name _Bracanastrepha_ as a subgenus of _Utetes_.   The species included in _Bracanastrepha_ by Fischer, but which lack the tibial carina (e. g. _Opius bucki_) are now placed in <a href=QQQQ?taxcpl=tax&amp;taxcpl_id=7511QQQQ>_Opius_</a>.  _Bracanastrepha_ is considered here to be confined to the New World.  Hosts of the _Utetes anastrephae_ species group are thus far confined to fruit-infesting tephritids, but unpublished records suggest that some attack closed related tephritids breeding in flowers.  XXXXXXXXThe species known to attack fruit-infesting Tephritidae include _Utetes__ anastrephae_ (=_argentina_ Br√®thes, type species of _Bracanastrepha_), _Utetes __divergens_ (Muesebeck), _Utetes __itatiayensis_ (Costa Lima),  _Utetes __tomoplagiae_ (Costa Lima), and _Utetes__ vierecki_ (Gahan).  There is some evidence that _Utetes anastrephae_ may actually be a complex of closely related species.  It is a widespread, color-variable species and the only species recorded repeatedly from different species of _Anastrepha_.  It is also the only species of this species group known from continental US (Florida).XXXXXXXXThe species in this species group may be distinguished as follows: _Utetes __divergens_ has the head, thorax, and wings mostly black (propodeum is yellow).  It occurs in northern Mexico, where it has been reared from _Anastrepha ludens_ in _Sargentia_ fruits.  The other species have the wings only lightly infumate (darkened) to nearly hyaline and the thorax is either entirely yellow to orange or yellow to orange with black markings on the mesoscutum and sometimes also the mesopleuron.XXXXXXXX_Utetes __itatiayensis_ and _Utetes __tomoplagiae_ are both known only from Brazil, where they have been reared or associated with tephritids in the genus _Tomoplagia_.  Almost nothing is known about these species other than the original records published by <ref id=QQQQ660QQQQ>Costa Lima (1937</ref>, <ref id=QQQQ1234QQQQ>1938)</ref>. _Utetes __itatiayensis_ is most readily identified by the sharp facial carina that extends between the bases of the antennae as an elevated ridge. The propodeum is also much less sculptured in this species than in the others, with the lateral fields mostly smooth.  _Utetes __tomoplagiae_ is most easily recognized by the small eye relative to the other species treated here.  The eye in lateral view is only slightly taller that the distance between the eye and the base of the mandible.  _Utetes anastrephae_, which also occurs in Brazil, has a distinctly larger eye than both _Utetes __itatiayensis_ and _Utetes __tomoplagiae_, and the ridge on the face in _Utetes anastrephae_ is much more weakly developed than in _Utetes __itatiayensis._  As noted above, _Utetes anastrephae_ may be a complex of closely related species, with perhaps subtle differences in ovipositor length, body sculpture, and host preferences.  It is a color-variable species, and different color morphs have been obtained from the same rearings.  The last species, _Utetes__ vierecki_, is known from Mexico and Panama, where it has been reared from _Anastrepha_.  It is similar to _Utetes anastrephae_ but has an even larger eye.   XXXXXXXX XXXX*The <a name=QQQQtruncatusQQQQ>_Utetes truncatus_</a> species group*XXXXXXXXBefore establishing his subgeneric classification, Fischer referred to the species now placed in _Utetes_ as the _truncatus_ species group, and this designation is retained here for the majority of the species attacking fruit-infesting tephritids.  _Utetes truncatus_ has been recorded from leaf-mining rather than fruit-infesting tephritids, yet I am unable to segregate _Utetes truncatus_ satisfactorily from the others on the basis of morphology.  <ref id=QQQQ738QQQQ>Wharton and Marsh (1978)</ref> observed that the North American species reared from tephritids are separable only with difficulty, and this holds for other species from throughout the world, which are remarkably similar to one another.  Known fruit-infesting hosts for the group include a wide range of tribes and genera in the subfamily Trypetinae as well as a few Tephritinae.  There is some indication that individual species may be fairly host specific, but this remains to be tested.   <ref id=QQQQ717QQQQ>Prokopy and Webster (1978)</ref> demonstrated that _Utetes canaliculatus_ (a senior subjective synonym of _Utetes lectus_) oviposits in the host eggs, a biological trait of interest to biological control workers that was discussed in the section treating the genus _Fopius_.  As in _<a href=QQQQ?taxcpl=tax&amp;taxcpl_id=7512QQQQ>Fopius</a>_, species of _Utetes_ show varying reductions of the subapical node on the ovipositor, suggesting an ability to use this morphological feature to predict behavior in the remainder of the species in which this biological trait has yet to be studied.  XXXXXXXXThe known parasitoids of fruit-infesting tephritids in the _Utetes truncatus_ species group include the following species, listed according to their geographic distribution:XXXX XXXX Nearctic (North American) species:XXXXXXXX     _Utetes aciurae_ (Fischer) from Florida attacking _Myoleja limata_ on species of _Ilex_.XXXX     _Utetes canaliculatus_ (Gahan), as interpreted here, this is an eastern species recorded from several  different species of _Rhagoletis.XXXX     Utetes frequens_ (Fischer) occurs across northern US from Maine to Washington and has been reared from cherry fruit flies in the genus _Rhagoletis.XXXX    Utetes juniperi _(Fischer) was described from Arizona, where it was reared from tephritids in juniper berries.

(1992)</ref>.  <ref id=QQQQ2746QQQQ>Wang and Messing (2003)</ref> explored the effects of several factors (indirect host stimuli, food supply, and mating status) on egg maturation in female _F. arisanus_, and found that only oviposition experience was directly associated with an increase in egg maturation.  The authors suggest that providing laboratory-reared _F. arisanus_ females with a constant supply of host eggs may increase parasitoid offspring in mass rearing, and maximize field parasitism of hosts after release.  Additional experiments indicated that intraspecific competition occurs in superparasitized medfly eggs, resulting in high mortality of supernumerary _F. arisanus_ eggs and first instar larvae by physiological suppression <ref id=QQQQ2747QQQQ>(Wang and Messing 2003)</ref>.XXXXXXXXAlthough a generalist parasitoid, _F. arisanus_ has achieved a competitive advantage over other introduced species in Hawaii.  <ref id=QQQQ2744QQQQ>Wang and Messing (2003)</ref> have shown several mechanisms by which _F. arisanus_ optimizes its parasitization capabilities including adjusting foraging time according to patch quality cues (presence of plant injury odors, kariomones, and previous experience in patch), utilizing a fixed set of host location behaviors (antennating, probing, detecting, and ovipositing), and discriminating nonparasitized from parasitized hosts for oviposition.  XXXXXXXXSimilar to results from previous experiments with _Diachasmimorpha tryoni_ (<ref id=QQQQ2747QQQQ>Wang and Messing 2003</ref>), _Diachasmimorpha krausii_, and _Psyttalia concolor_ (<ref id=QQQQ2676QQQQ>Wang and Messing 2002</ref>), <ref id=QQQQ22028QQQQ>Wang et al. (2003)</ref> found that _F. arisanus_ was the superior competitor when matched with _Diachasmimorpha longicaudata_.  As an egg parasite, _F. arisanus_ arrives on the host (_Ceratitis capitata_ and _Bactrocera dorsalis_ in these experiments) prior to _D. longicaudata_, a larval parasite, and suppresses development of _D. longicaudata_, primarily at the egg stage.  The authors also report that in experiments with the 4 larval parasitoids none were able to directly destroy _F. arisanus_ larvae during parasitism.  Although a superior competitor among many fruit fly parasitoids, _F. arisanus_ does not flourish in all environments including higher elevations and lower temperatures, and is not adapted to certain tephritid hosts including _Bactrocera cucurbitae_.

646	"During the exploration phase of the Oriental fruit fly program, several of the opiines from Kenya were variously identified as color varieties of _Psyttalia concolor_ or as _Psyttalia perproxima_ (<ref id=QQQQ54QQQQ>Clausen et al. 1965</ref>).  Material from the same localities had been identified as either _P. humilis_ or _P. perproxima_  during an earlier sampling program (<ref id=QQQQ812QQQQ>Bianchi and Krauss, 1936</ref>).  Difficulty in identification of these three nominal species is still a problem (<ref id=QQQQ1229QQQQ>Kimani-Njogu et al. 2001</ref>), and uncertainty over whether or not they are distinct makes it difficult to correctly associate previously published host records.  _Psyttalia concolor_ was originally described from Tunisia, _P. humilis_ from Cape Province of South Africa, and _P. perproxima_ from Benin, Ghana, and Nigeria in West Africa. In some of the more recent studies, populations from Kenya have been tentatively identified as _P. concolor_ because of reproductive compatibility with populations from Italy (<ref id=QQQQ1229QQQQ>Kimani-Njogu et al. 2001</ref>, <ref id=QQQQ1228QQQQ>Wharton et al. 2000</ref>). Because the two populations are genetically distinct, however, laboratory studies need to be expanded to determine reproductive compatibility under field conditions. XXXXXXXXSimilarly, two decades after the purposeful introduction of _P. concolor_ to Italy to control olive fly, _Bactrocera oleae_ (Rossi), <ref id=QQQQ186QQQQ>Monastero (1931)</ref> described _Psyttalia siculus_ from Sicily as a parasitoid of _B. oleae_.  Considerable debate ensued over whether _P. siculus_ was actually distinct from _P. concolor_ (<ref id=QQQQ190QQQQ>Monastero, 1934</ref>; <ref id=QQQQ75QQQQ>Delucchi, 1957</ref>).  <ref id=QQQQ443QQQQ>Fischer (1963</ref>, <ref id=QQQQ608QQQQ>1971</ref>, <ref id=QQQQ482QQQQ>1972</ref>) treated _P. siculus_ as a subspecies of _P. concolor_ with slightly longer ovipositor, and retained _P. humilis_ as distinct from _P. concolor_ QQQQbecause of differences in morphology of developmental stages.QQQQXXXXXXXXThree other species from Africa are also difficult to distinguish from _Psyttalia concolor_: _Psyttalia dacicida_ (Silvestri) reared from _Bactrocera oleae_ in Eritrea, _Psyttalia dexter_ (Silvestri) reared from _Dacus longistylus_ in Senegal, and _Psyttalia inconsueta_ (Silvestri) reared from _Carpophthoromyia tritea_ in southern Nigeria.  Almost nothing is known of these three species other than the information provided by Silvestri from his original collections made prior to 1914. _Psyttalia lounsburyi_ (Silvestri) is also similar to _concolor_ and the other species mentioned here but is much darker in coloration.  It has been reared from olive fly infesting wild and cultivated olives in South Africa and wild olives in Kenya.XXXXXXXXThe distribution of _Psyttalia rhagoleticola_ may overlap that of the other Palaearctic species, _Psyttalia ponerophaga_ (Silvestri), known only from collections made in Cherat, northern Pakistan.  The latter species was reared from olive fly, _Bactrocera oleae_, in wild olives while _P. rhagoleticola_ attacks species of tephritids in the genus _Rhagoletis_ infesting stone fruits. _Psyttalia ponerophaga_ is one of the few parasitoids of fruit-infesting tephritids in this genus in which at least some members have the fore wing m-cu entering the second submarginal cell.
